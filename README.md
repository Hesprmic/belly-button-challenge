# belly-button-challenge
This was by far the most difficult challenge to date! Javascript has tough for me to grasp. I will continue to practice to help myself fully understand what we were achieving with this homework challenge. First and foremost I would like to attribute a lot of this code to working with Tyler. He was extremely helpful in fully explaining how to work through this. I think one of the things that made this so difficult was the absence of outline within the app.js. Used D3 libraries to read in the data from the samples.json file. Created a bar chart. Created a bubble chart. Chose to skip the bonus due to already being late. May add later on down the road for practice.
